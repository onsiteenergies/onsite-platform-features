# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

  Implement multi-select functionality for fuel tanks and equipment in the customer booking form, and create an admin interface for managing all customers' fuel tanks and equipment. This includes:
  1. Update frontend CustomerDashboard to allow selecting multiple tanks and equipment using multi-select UI components
  2. Update backend to accept and process arrays of selected tank/equipment IDs
  3. Create admin interface (new Resources tab) for viewing, creating, editing, and deleting tanks/equipment for all customers
  4. Add customer filtering in the admin resources view
  5. Maintain backward compatibility with existing single-select bookings

      Completed implementation of multi-select tanks/equipment for customer bookings and admin resource management interface.
      
      Backend changes:
      - Updated BookingCreate model to accept selected_tank_ids and selected_equipment_ids arrays
      - Modified create_booking endpoint to fetch full tank/equipment details from IDs and populate booking
      - Added admin-only CRUD endpoints for managing all customers' tanks (/api/admin/fuel-tanks/*)
      - Added admin-only CRUD endpoints for managing all customers' equipment (/api/admin/equipment/*)
      
      Frontend changes:
      - Replaced single-select dropdowns with multi-select UI using Popover + Command components
      - Updated booking state to use arrays
      - Enhanced booking cards to display multiple tanks/equipment with colored badges
      - Created AdminResourcesManagement component with tabs, filters, and CRUD forms
      - Integrated Resources tab into AdminDashboard
      
      Test credentials:
      - Admin: admin@fuel.com / admin123
      - Customer: test@fuel.com / password123
      
      Priority test scenarios:
      1. Customer creates booking with multiple tanks and multiple equipment selected
      2. Verify selected tanks/equipment display correctly in booking card
      3. Admin accesses Resources tab
      4. Admin creates tank for a customer
      5. Admin creates equipment for a customer
      6. Admin edits and deletes resources
      7. Admin filters resources by customer
      8. Verify backward compatibility - old bookings with single tank_name/equipment_name still display correctly
